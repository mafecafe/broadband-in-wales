          <p>The rural and urban divide is something quite obvious to most, it is the difference between living in a bright yet grey and bustling city, compared to beautiful rolling green hills far from civilisation. However, it begs the question, can I still stay connected if I pick the rolling green hills over the convenience of a city? With the average internet speed in welsh rural areas being around 42 megabits per second (mb/s) which is still considered fast internet, this still pales in comparison to the 66 mb/s average in urban areas of Wales.</p>
          <p class='para'>Some might argue that rural areas have less of a need for fast internet and therefore do not require the infrastructure. However, with the digital boom of the last 40 years, according to Robert Dangerfield of the Country Land and Business Association, even farmers need broadband to fill in important forms to ensure funding and to run their businesses.  So how bad is the situation in the rural areas in Wales? According to Ofcom and the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 59% of postcodes in rural areas are either unconnected or are not paying for broadband. As can be seen from the graph above, very few rural postcodes have internet speed exceeding the 50mb/s range and how this compares to the urban areas. This tells us there is a serious need for ultra high speed broadband infrastructure in Wales.</p>

          <p class='para'>Dan,  who lives in a small rural village in Ceredigion tells us that “despite some houses in his area receiving fibre internet, his house is still struggling to achieve even 5 Mbps internet speed.” Despite writing to BT and the Welsh government, they still have not been of any help as neither will take responsibility for the lack of internet he gets.  This is clearly an infrastructure problem as if he is the only house in his village not achieving higher internet speeds, why is his house in particular not joined up to the faster broadband. </p>
          <p class='para'>Ben Lake, the Westminster MP for Ceredigion told us that even with “superfast” (30 Mbps - 300 Mbps)  internet  being rolled out to more and more rural areas in his constituency, what he is finding is that the infrastructure just is not good enough. This is because they’re finding that when  the higher speeds are offered in a new area, everyone signs up for it and that the infrastructure, although capable of delivering the higher speeds, simply does not because of the high number of people using it. Therefore implying that the infrastructure in place is not up to the job to meet the quoted supply and demand.  He also believes that the Welsh government is not prioritising the roll out of high speed internet to rural areas enough, and that despite a recent top up in funding, that they could still do better.<p>
          <p class='para'>With a mass increase of people staying at home due to the pandemic and working from home becoming even more essential, even internet speeds in urban areas, despite being faster, are still not up to scratch for some. Cardiff university  students claim that their internet regularly drops and is so slow that it has affected their access to online zoom lectures,  resources and even assignments. Some  students even tell us that even though the higher speeds are available to them, that they can’t afford to pay the large sums of money required to obtain it, and that this has caused tension with house mates because the internet is so slow. So despite the better average speeds in urban areas, this creates  questions around how widely available are these speeds and how affordable is it.<p>
          <p class='para'>Looking at all the postcodes in Wales which don’t have internet, it was found that some areas had drastic numbers. For example Llandrindod has nearly 1,500 postcodes without internet, 100% of which are in rural areas. Although less severe, in Llandudno 64% of their postcodes with no internet are rural. This is in stark contrast to areas like Cardiff and Newport where 88% and 77% of their postcodes respectively  without internet are urban. However, these statistics could be due to the fact that Llandudno and Llandrindod are mostly rural postcode areas. It is also important to note that Newport and Cardiff, despite being mostly urban areas, have the highest percentages of postcodes not receiving internet. This means that the majority of postcodes in Cardiff and Newport where either they don’t have internet connection or are not paying for it are in urban areas. This could be down to the potentially high prices of broadband in urban areas as highlighted by cardiff university students above. With Virgin Media charging prices starting at £44 a month for broadband, this is potentially out of reach for many who may have more important things to pay for.</p>
          <p class='para'>We can see that the rural urban divide is obvious when it comes to internet speeds and infrastructure. The average internet speed in Welsh rural areas is 24 Mbps slower than the urban areas. Not only that, but 59% of rural postcodes do not have access to the internet. However, this does not mean that urban postcodes have it well off either, with potentially expensive internet and the speeds still not meeting the standards required to work efficiently at home</p>
