      <p>In the village of Llanfilo in Brecon there is no fibre broadband. Richard Feasey who is an advisor on the National Infrastructure Commission for Wales, has to rely on 4G connection for his Zoom calls from home. This can be a challenge because many of the areas around Brecon don’t have  good internet services, Richard explained just before his connection got cut off.
      </p>
      <p>When the pandemic hit, one third of postcodes in Wales didn’t have an  internet speed of above 10 Mbps, considered the minimum by Ofcom. They were essentially disconnected.
      </p>
      <p>Robert Dangerfield needs an internet connection to work from home too. He works at the Country Land and Business Association where he advises small businesses and landowners. In his rural area in Brecon, internet speeds are slow. When the pandemic began, Robert and some of the businesses he represents, started having problems with their connection.
      </p>
      <p>“I have a standard domestic link. But since I've been working from home, I've been asking so much more of it.” he explains. “So for example if I'm uploading video content to YouTube, everything else in my house which requires broadband simply will not work.”</p>
      <p>He says that a good internet connection is essential for him, like “oxygen in the air.”</p>
      <p>Working and studying from home during the pandemic increased internet usage for households, and for some of them the minimum internet speed of 10 Mbps was out of reach. One person in Ceredigion told us in an online survey he had a  connection that only managed 1 Mbps, just enough to send an email. “I now have 4G internet, but because the masts have so much traffic going through them due to over-selling contracts, even that becomes useless at times.”</p>
      <p>Good internet connections in rural areas change lives, says Ben Lake of Plaid  Cymru, MP for Ceredigion and member of the Welsh Affairs Committee. “The delivery of public services in rural areas, whether that is GP provision, whether it is public transport, starts to benefit.” “Things such as greater e-learning resources become possible,” he says, “things such as digital consultations with doctors become possible.”
      </p>
      <p>The UK government is planning to connect at least 85% of the UK population with extremely fast internet (1,000 Mbps) by 2025. But the road from copper infrastructure to fibre is not a straightforward one. The government has promised £5 billion to build this high speed internet infrastructure but so far only half of this budget has been allocated, and only half of the allocated money (£1.2 billion) is to be spent in the next couple of years.
      </p>
      <p>”In telecoms, £1.2 billion is not a lot of money. It doesn't get you very much,” says Richard Feasey. “We think that the government in the UK will end up needing to spend significantly more than that: probably not much less than 10 billion.”</p>
      <p>The National Infrastructure Commission estimates that Wales is going to need £1.3 billion in order to lay high speed fibre to every premises. But since that is more than 20% of the whole UK budget for the project, the Welsh government will not be able to afford it anytime soon. “The Welsh government is going to get a relatively small amount of money,” says Feasey.
      </p>
      <p>Financing is not the only struggle in Wales though: internet providers often won’t invest in certain parts of the country. Customers in some areas find themselves in a predicament because the speeds are lower than in other areas, the prices are high, and the choice between providers is minimal.
      </p>
      <p>Maldwyn Owen runs Ynys Garage in Pontypridd, a small business that uses the internet to log MOT tests. When he tried to change internet providers, he found that the same cables were being used and there was no change in the actual speed.</p>
      <p>“We have had incidents where suppliers have sent us emails regarding parts and diagrams for a vehicle,” he says. “And we have not been able to access them because the internet has dropped out completely.”</p>
      <p>Tom Crick is a professor of Digital Education and Policy at Swansea University and is also a member of the National Infrastructure Commission for Wales. He says BT owns most of the infrastructure because they used to be the national provider. “But if we wanted to facilitate competition, it's so hard to get into that market. So new entrants are going to find it very, very hard to compete against BT.” </p>
      <p>Higher prices for better internet services can be a barrier too. Even if the infrastructure can deliver greater speeds, people won’t always pay to use the technology.</p>
      <p>“There's a problem there that often technology isn't a priority, it can't be, because people can't afford it,” says Danielle Roberts, a digital inclusion advisor on the Welsh government initiative Digital Communities Wales. She works with places in Wales where people need help to access internet services.</p>
      <p>The Welsh government finances schemes like the Broadband Upgrade Fund, Broadband Access Cymru and Gigabit Voucher to help people cover the cost of a new internet connection to their homes. And although places like Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire are signing up for government funding, it’s sometimes unclear who can apply for it.
      </p>
      <p>“It causes confusion to a lot of people because they're not sure who's responsible for the whole broadband agenda,” says Ceri Jenkins, a digital connectivity officer at Carmarthenshire County Council. She says it’s not always clear “who is running the scheme, where is the money coming from.”The Broadband Upgrade Fund and Gigabit Voucher scheme are available for communities or businesses, but individuals cannot apply for them.</p>
      <p>Jenkins works with councils to help them increase the quality of local people’s internet connection. For some of those schemes, which started last July, it is too early to say whether they have been successful in connecting people yet. “Many communities have come together, many are still talking with suppliers, some have chosen their supplier. So we will be able to see results maybe in the next six months,” Jenkins says enthusiastically.</p>
      <p>Being disconnected in a global pandemic is a nightmare scenario. But getting fibre to all Welsh homes will take time, and for communities who are the most in need of the connection right now, experts say there are alternatives. Members of the National Infrastructure Commission have advised the government that fibre is not always the best option. “Instead of waiting and trying to do absolutely everything with fibre, actually use 5G now, and then the pressure to build out the fibre in some areas will be reduced,” says Feasey.</p>
      <p>Until then, Robert, Maldwyn, Richard and many other people in the same position, will have to try to stay online with the speeds available to them.</p>
