          <p>For people in Wales looking to improve their internet speed there are three schemes available: Access Broadband Cymru,
             the Gigabit Voucher scheme, and the Welsh Government Top-up.</p>
          <p>The schemes offer grants for people and businesses to install new broadband connections and achieve greater speeds, although not everyone will be eligible for the scheme.
             </p>
          <h3>Access Broadband Cymru</h3>
          <p>Provides grants to fund all or some of installation costs for new broadband connections for homes and businesses in Wales.
             It does not cover the monthly subscription cost to the services. The new connections should be able to deliver at least double the internet speeds customers are currently receiving
              e.g. a current connection of 10Mbps must improve to at least 20Mbps.The connection options available are fibre broadband, fixed wireless connection, mobile (4G) connection, and satellite connection.</p>
          <h4>Grants Available:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>£400 for a new speed of 10Mbit/s and above. </li>
            <li>£800 for a new speed of 30 Mbit/s and above.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the full list of eligibility requirements:

          <h3>Gigabit Voucher Scheme</h3>
          <p>A UK Government scheme that provides grants to  homes and businesses to cover the costs of installing 'gigabit broadband', which is extremely fast internet (1000Mbit/s). It is designed for communities that don't want to wait for the current Project Gigabit rollout to reach them. Single connections are not available for the scheme.</p>
          <h4>Grants Available:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Up to £1,500 for residents</li>

          </ul>
          <h4>Eligibility:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>People with existing broadband speeds of less than 100 Mbit/s</li>
            <li>People living in areas where a commercial gigabit network is not likely to be built in the near future </li>
            <li>Areas with no government-funded contract planned to improve the existing broadband network </li>
            <li>Area must be defined as rural</li>
            <li>Two or more residents and/ or businesses must be applying together</li>
          </ul>

              <h5 class="card-title">The case of Michaelston-y-Fedw</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The village of Michaelston-y-Fedw, just 10 miles from Cardiff, had internet speeds of 4Mbps three years ago. BT hadn’t included the village in its Superfast Cymru project and so in 2018 the residents of Michaelston-y-Fedw set up their non-profit Community Interest Company to build their own fibre network. They were able to initially raise £150,000 to go towards laying the infrastructure and when the project was up and running, they applied for two of the government schemes, Access Broadband Cymru and Gigabit Voucher, to finance the rest.</p>
              <p class='card-text'>“We originally set out to connect about 100 properties. Now we’ve connected over 240. And we've got about another 160 to connect this year,” says David Schofield, a director of the Community Interest Company. “We received for every residential property £800, for every business £3,000,” he explained.</p>
              <p class='card-text'>Now most of the properties and businesses in the village, and some of the surrounding areas, have gigabit capable internet, with speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (or 1 Gbps). Their project will come to an end this year when the surrounding areas of the village are all connected to the network.</p>
              <p class='card-text'>“We feel more connected, amongst ourselves for one, because it is a community project,” says David. “But also connected to the outside world.”</p>

          </div>
          <h3>Welsh Government Top-up</h3>
          <p>Works with the UK government Gigabit Voucher Scheme and is for residents or businesses, in rural areas, which receive internet speeds of less than 30 Mbit/s.
             No separate application is required as eligible properties will receive the top-up funding when benefiting from a Rural Gigabit Voucher scheme.</p>
          <h4>Grants Available:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Up to an additional £1,500 for residents</li>
            <li>Up to an additional £3,500 for businesses</li>
          </ul>
