      <p class= 'para'>
       When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, people weren't ready. Systems and countries trembled, and everybody’s life came to a halt. In this time of isolation, the internet kept millions connected and integrated into society. But not everyone was so lucky.</p>
       <p>In Wales, more than 30,000 postcodes did not have a good enough broadband connection or a connection at all, meaning the people living there couldn’t engage in the new, digital, life. They were excluded from online shopping, banking, and schooling.</p>
      <p>The average internet speed in Wales is 57.5 megabits per second (Mbps) which is classified as superfast broadband. At this speed, users can download a one-hour Netflix film in around seven minutes. However, almost two thirds of postcodes connected to broadband perform below this average.</p>
      <p>This map shows the average speed of all postcodes in Wales. Type a postcode in the search bar and see how fast the internet in that area is.</p>

  <section class='section-2'>
      <p class='para'>The pandemic shed light on an issue that has affected thousands of people for years. Wales’ internet has been historically bad compared to the rest of the UK and Wales’ broadband issue doesn’t affect people equally. Rural settlements suffer from more digital exclusion than urban ones, and the south-east of Wales has, on average, much better connection than the rest of the country.</p>
      <p>
          Now that fast broadband seems to be synonymous with a healthy economy, the UK and Welsh governments are using schemes and programmes to keep people connected. But the challenges of filling the gap remain.
